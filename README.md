# 🏡 Airbnb 

A full-stack web app that brings the Airbnb experience to life — built with Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB.

## 🎯 Purpose of This Project

The goal of this project was to learn and implement full-stack web development by recreating the core functionalities of Airbnb — focusing on backend logic, authentication, data modeling, and interactive UI.

This project helped me understand how to design and connect frontend and backend systems, manage databases, and create a real-world CRUD-based web app using modern technologies.
